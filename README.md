# todolist-noDB-app

Completed with upgrades from my final assessment with the Generation bootcamp for SpringBoot and Fullstack applications.

## Updates

- Simple 2 page To-do list application used to record a TODO item with these fields: Category, Title, Description/Detail and Due Date.
- Allows user to record, update and delete the item (after completion).
- Added feature to alert user on the same page when item is successfully/unsuccessfully added, updated or removed.

## Changes required

- Working on adding MySQL database.
- Additional field for clicking completion checkbox - updates the backend for TODOItem so it stays completed.
