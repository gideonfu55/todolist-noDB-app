# todolist-noDB-app

- Simple 2 page To-do list application used to record a TODO item with these fields: Category, Title, Description/Detail and Due Date.
- Allows user to record, update and delete the item (after completion).
- Completed with upgrades from one of my assessments at with Generation programme for SpringBoot and the fullstack.

## Changes required

- Working on adding MySQL database.
- Additional field for clicking completion checkbox - updates the backend for TODOItem so it stays completed.
